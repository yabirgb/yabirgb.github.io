      <description>In this serie of posts I want to summarize what I have archieved, what I&amp;rsquo;m doing and share things I liked from the previous month.
What I did  I joined to the Google HashCode 2018 with the Oh no team. We ended up in a good position with a total score of 36,448,230. The code is available at github.
 Started to record my study habits in a spreadsheet so now I count all the hours I spend studying and what I study.</description>

      <description>Recently I have tried, as the title says, scape from google as much I can. The first thing to care is my smartphone.
I use a OnePlus One, so it has android inside. Since a year or so I&amp;rsquo;m using LineageOS with a custom ROM, TugaPower. All the time I have been using Gapps but now I updated to the Android 8.1 beta of my ROM and installed microG.
MicroG is a project aiming to replace the Google&amp;rsquo;s code in Android smartphones with a free software clone of the libraries from Google used by apps.</description>
